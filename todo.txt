remove tune from dataset if it contains:
'w:' - lyrics
'[.*]' - double stops


strip from tune field:
'".*"' - chord symbols etc.
'{.*}' - grace notes (ornament)
'~' - turn (ornament)




some tunes include /r/n, others (e.g. setting 17109) use only /r. would maybe be worth converting all/any combinations of /r and /n to just a single /r (or maybe just removing, since i don't think line breaks are important...?)
